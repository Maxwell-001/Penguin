# CSS Penguin
Welcome to my CSS Penguin project! This cute little penguin was created as a fun way for me to explore HTML and CSS and practice my skills in web development.

## Features:
#### Pure HTML and CSS: 
The entire penguin is created using only HTML elements and CSS styles. No JavaScript or external libraries were used.
#### CSS Styling: 
I've utilized CSS to style each element of the penguin, including its body, eyes, beak, and feet.
#### Creative Design: 
While I'm a beginner, I've tried to inject some creativity into the design of the penguin, making it as cute and appealing as possible.
#### Learning Opportunity: 
Through building this project, I've gained hands-on experience with CSS positioning, styling, and selectors.
## Usage:
#### Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

*git clone (repository-url)*
#### Open in Browser: 
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the penguin.

#### Interact: 
Feel free to interact with the penguin by hovering over elements or clicking on different parts to see how they react.

#### Learn: 
Within the CSS file, I've left comments to explain my thought process and the techniques I've used to style the penguin. Feel free to read through and learn from my experience!

## Contributions:
While this project is primarily a learning exercise for me, I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you have any ideas for enhancing the penguin's design, or if you spot any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
